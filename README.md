# Homemade Algo -  Implementing Algorithms in C/C++

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms in C and some in C++. The main goal of this repository is to serve as a learning resource and a personal reference. The code works but might not be perfect, and the memory deallocation methods are not always included for simplicity.
